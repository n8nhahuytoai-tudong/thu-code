Create a vertical 9:16 video, 40 seconds long, photorealistic 3D CGI animation style.

A heartwarming wildlife rescue story on a quiet beach. A small brown seal with wet, glossy fur is resting on a smooth golden sand beach. The beach is peaceful, with gentle rolling sand dunes and a calm turquoise ocean visible in the distance. The sky is overcast with soft grey-blue clouds, creating diffused natural lighting without harsh shadows.

The seal suddenly notices something unusual - a giant orca whale, easily 8 times its size, has beached on the sand nearby. The orca has the distinctive black and white coloring with cream-white eye patches and belly. The massive whale is lying motionless on its side, breathing faintly.

The seal immediately reacts with concern and begins running across the beach toward the orca. Its flippers move rapidly as it crosses the sand, kicking up small sand particles. The camera smoothly follows the seal's determined journey, showing the vast distance it must cover.

When the seal reaches the orca, the dramatic size difference becomes clear - the tiny seal looks up at the enormous whale. The seal carefully approaches the orca's head, moving with gentle caution. It stands up on its hind flippers and reaches out to touch the orca's face with its small front flippers.

Close-up shots show the intimate moment: the seal's wet brown fur with individual strands visible, its long white whiskers, and caring expression in its dark eyes. The seal gently places its paws on the orca's smooth black skin near the distinctive white eye patch. Golden sand particles cling to the orca's wet cream-white belly.

The seal continues touching the orca's face with tender concern, almost as if trying to comfort or wake the giant whale. The orca's large eye remains closed at first, but then slowly begins to open. The eye reveals life, with the pupil dilating and a slight reflection of the caring seal visible on its surface. This is the emotional climax - a moment of hope and connection between two different species.

The seal maintains its gentle touch, comforting the orca. The scene conveys deep emotion - compassion, hope, and the unexpected bonds in nature.

Camera movement: Begin with wide establishing shots showing the scale and isolation of the scene. Smoothly track the seal's running movement across the beach. Gradually push in to medium shots as the seal reaches the orca. Finish with intimate close-up shots of the touching moment, using shallow depth of field to blur the ocean background and focus on the emotional interaction.

Visual details: Photorealistic textures including wet seal fur with water droplets, smooth glossy orca skin, fine granular sand, natural animal breathing movements. The seal's whiskers should be clearly visible and move naturally. Sand should stick realistically to wet surfaces. All movement should follow natural physics and animal behavior.

Lighting: Soft, overcast natural lighting creating a peaceful mood. No harsh shadows. Cool color temperature with warm golden tones from the sand. Subtle rim lighting on the seal's fur from the sky.

Color palette: Rich chocolate brown for the seal's fur, deep glossy black and cream-white for the orca, warm golden-yellow sand (#DAA520), cool grey-blue sky (#B0C4DE), soft turquoise ocean (#5F9EA0).

Style: Professional wildlife documentary cinematography. Emotional and touching atmosphere. Smooth 60fps motion throughout. Photorealistic 3D CGI with cinema-quality rendering.

Aspect ratio: Vertical 9:16 (1080x1920). Duration: 40 seconds.

## 📖 VERSION 3: STORYTELLING STYLE

Veo 3 có thể respond tốt với narrative style:

```
Tell a 40-second visual story in vertical 9:16 format:

On a quiet, overcast beach with golden sand and grey-blue skies, a lone brown seal rests peacefully. Suddenly, the seal spots something alarming - a giant orca whale has washed ashore and lies motionless on the sand.

Without hesitation, the small seal springs into action, running across the beach with determined urgency. Its wet fur glistens as it moves, flippers working hard to reach the enormous whale.

When it arrives, the seal doesn't flee from the massive predator. Instead, it approaches with gentleness and concern. Standing on its hind flippers, the tiny seal reaches up to touch the orca's face with its paws.

The camera moves close to capture this tender moment - the seal's whiskers trembling, its dark eyes full of worry, as it tries to comfort the giant whale. Sand clings to the orca's white belly. The seal pats the orca's head near its eye patch.

Then, a sign of hope: the orca's huge eye slowly opens, revealing consciousness. The seal continues its caring touch, connecting across species in an unexpected moment of compassion.

Style: Photorealistic 3D CGI animation, cinematic wildlife documentary aesthetic, soft natural overcast lighting, detailed textures of wet fur and smooth whale skin, emotional and heartwarming tone, professional camera work with smooth movements, 60fps quality.
