### EDITORIAL NOTES
```
Edit In:  Cut from Scene 3 on wing fold (00:02 of action)
          (Scene 3 shows lock-on 00:00-00:02, then cut)
Edit Out: Cut mid-dive (don't show impact yet)
          Scene 5 starts with Rex reaction (reversal)
Pacing:   FAST - adrenaline shot
Rhythm:   Accelerando (musical term - speeding up)

Shot Purpose:
- Escalate tension dramatically (calm → chaos)
- Establish Terror as serious threat (not just observing)
- Kinetic energy injection (wake audience up!)
- Commit to conflict (no turning back now)

Editing Style:
- Quick cut entry (no slow build)
- Match action: Wing fold is cut point
- Sound bridge: Screech starts in Scene 3, peaks here
- Possible: Intercut B-cam wide shot (0.5s insert at 00:04)

Reference Films:
- "Top Gun: Maverick" - Jet dive sequences (speed, angle)
- "How to Train Your Dragon" - Dragon attack dives
- "The Hobbit" - Eagle rescue dives (scale, grace)
- "Peregrine falcon hunt" (nature doc - real dive physics)

Camera Feel:
- Visceral: Audience IS the camera, following attacker
- POV-adjacent: Not Terror's eyes, but riding with him
- Kinetic: Movement is character (not static observer)

Music Notes:
- Attack motif: Introduced here (recurring theme)
- Instrumentation: Aggressive strings, brass hits
- Rhythm: Accelerating (matches dive speed increase)
- Dynamics: pp → fff (whisper to scream)
```
