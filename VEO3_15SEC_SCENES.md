```
Create a vertical 9:16 video, 15 seconds long, photorealistic 3D CGI animation, 60fps.

Opening scene on a peaceful golden sand beach under an overcast grey-blue sky. The beach is vast and empty, with gentle rolling sand dunes in the mid-ground and a calm turquoise ocean visible in the distant background. Soft natural lighting with no harsh shadows creates a serene but melancholic atmosphere.

In the foreground, a small brown seal is resting on the smooth sand. The seal has wet, glossy fur in rich chocolate brown color, with a lighter cream-colored belly. Its fur texture shows individual strands, slightly clumped from being wet. The seal has a round expressive face with large dark eyes, long white whiskers that are clearly visible, and short flippers. The seal is about 1.2 meters long.

The seal suddenly notices something unusual and turns its head toward the distance. Camera pulls back slightly to reveal what the seal sees: a giant orca whale has beached on the sand about 30 meters away. The orca is massive - approximately 8 meters long, making it 6-7 times larger than the seal. The orca has distinctive glossy black skin on top with cream-white patches - a white eye patch near its head and white belly. The whale is lying on its side, motionless but breathing faintly.

The seal's body language changes to show concern and alertness. Without hesitation, the seal begins running across the beach toward the beached orca. Its movement is urgent and determined.

Camera work: The shot dynamically follows the seal's running movement with smooth tracking. Show the seal's flippers moving rapidly in realistic seal locomotion - body undulating, pushing off with flippers. Small sand particles are kicked up slightly behind the seal as it moves. Multiple dynamic angles show the seal's journey: side view showing full body movement, low angle emphasizing determination, and wide shots showing the decreasing distance between seal and orca.

As the seal runs, maintain the background with sand dunes and grey sky. The massive orca grows larger in frame as the seal approaches. The final seconds show the seal covering good distance, now much closer to the giant whale, still running with purpose.

Visual details: Photorealistic wet fur texture with subtle highlights and water droplets. Natural animal weight and physics. Smooth sand texture with fine granular details. The seal's whiskers should move naturally with motion. Realistic breathing movement in the seal's body. The orca in background should remain mostly still except for very subtle breathing.

Lighting: Soft overcast daylight, cool color temperature (slightly blue-shifted), warm golden tones from the sand. Subtle rim lighting on seal's fur from the diffused sky light.

Color palette: Rich chocolate brown seal (#4A2511), warm golden sand (#DAA520), deep glossy black orca (#0A0A0A), cream-white orca patches (#FFF8DC), cool grey-blue sky (#B0C4DE), soft turquoise ocean (#5F9EA0).

Camera movement: Begin with static wide establishing shot (2 seconds), then smoothly transition to dynamic tracking following the seal's run (remaining 13 seconds). Camera stays at low to medium height, ground level perspective. Natural smooth movements, no jarring cuts.

Emotion: Builds from peaceful solitude to urgent concern and determination. The seal shows bravery approaching something so much larger.

End the scene with the seal still in motion, approaching the orca, setting up for continuation.

## 🎥 CẢNH 2: ARRIVAL & FIRST CONTACT (15-30s)
### "Đến nơi và tiếp xúc lần đầu"

Copy và paste prompt này vào Veo 3:

```
Create a vertical 9:16 video, 15 seconds long, photorealistic 3D CGI animation, 60fps.

Continue from previous scene: A small brown seal with wet glossy fur is running across a golden sand beach toward a giant beached orca whale. The seal is now close to the massive orca.

The seal arrives at the orca's side, slowing down from its run. Camera angle shifts to emphasize the dramatic size difference - the orca is enormous, about 8 meters long, while the seal is tiny at just 1.2 meters. The orca lies on its side on the sand, its glossy black back and distinctive cream-white eye patches and belly visible. Golden sand particles stick to the wet white belly area. The whale breathes very slowly and faintly, showing it's alive but weak.

The seal pauses for a moment, taking in the situation. Its body language shows both caution and deep concern. The seal looks up at the massive whale, then carefully begins to approach the orca's head area.

Camera work: Medium shots showing both animals in frame, emphasizing scale. The camera slowly orbits around to show the seal moving from the orca's mid-body toward its head. Smooth camera movement, gradually pushing closer as the seal approaches the orca's face.

The seal moves with gentle, cautious steps along the orca's body. Its wet flippers leave small prints in the sand. The seal reaches the orca's head area - the orca's large eye is visible but closed. The seal carefully positions itself near the orca's face.

Then, showing incredible compassion, the small seal stands up on its hind flippers. This position shows its full small size compared to the orca's massive head. The seal reaches out with its front flippers and gently places them on the orca's head, near the distinctive white eye patch. This is the first touch - a tender, caring gesture.

Close-up shots (last 5 seconds): Camera pushes in to intimate close-up showing the touching moment. Details become visible: the seal's wet brown fur with individual strands, long white whiskers moving slightly, the seal's dark expressive eyes showing concern. The seal's small paw rests on the orca's smooth, glossy black skin. The size contrast is striking - the seal's entire paw is tiny against the orca's massive head.

Visual details: Highly detailed textures - wet seal fur with water droplets and natural clumping, smooth reflective orca skin (black and white areas), fine sand granules sticking to wet orca belly, visible breathing movement in both animals. The seal's whiskers should be clearly defined. Natural physics - the seal's weight distributes realistically on sand, orca's mass presses into sand creating slight depression.

Background: Golden sand beach, overcast grey-blue sky, calm turquoise ocean in soft focus (shallow depth of field in close-ups). Soft natural lighting continues.

Lighting: Soft overcast light, no harsh shadows. As camera moves to close-up, use shallow depth of field to blur background and focus on the emotional connection. Subtle rim light on seal's fur and orca's skin.

Color palette: Same as before - rich brown seal, golden sand, glossy black and cream-white orca, grey-blue sky.

Camera movement: Starts with medium tracking shots following seal's movement. Gradually transitions to slow push-in toward close-up of the touching moment. Final shot is intimate close-up. Smooth, gentle camera movements matching the tender mood.

Emotion: Transitions from cautious concern to brave compassion to tender caring. This is the emotional heart beginning - small helping large, showing interspecies empathy.

End scene with close-up of seal's paw on orca's face, holding this touching moment, ready to continue.

## 🎥 CẢNH 3: HOPE & CONNECTION (30-45s)
### "Hy vọng và kết nối"

Copy và paste prompt này vào Veo 3:

```
Create a vertical 9:16 video, 15 seconds long, photorealistic 3D CGI animation, 60fps.

Continue from previous scene: Intimate close-up of a small brown seal gently touching a giant beached orca's face with its flippers on a golden sand beach.

The seal maintains its caring touch, standing on hind flippers with front paws resting on the orca's head near the distinctive white eye patch. The seal's expression shows deep concern and care in its large dark eyes. Its long white whiskers are prominent and clearly visible, moving slightly with small head movements. The seal's wet chocolate-brown fur shows incredible detail - individual hair strands, natural clumping, water droplets catching soft light.

Camera work: Begin with close-up of the seal touching the orca's face. The camera holds this intimate moment for several seconds, allowing the emotion to build. Very slow, subtle camera movement - gentle push in toward the orca's eye area.

The seal gently pats the orca's head, almost as if trying to comfort or wake the giant whale. One small paw touches near the orca's eye. The seal's caring gesture is tender and deliberate - showing true compassion between different species.

Then comes the crucial moment of hope (around 7-8 second mark): The orca's large eye begins to slowly open. The eye is highly detailed - dark pupil, slight moisture on the surface creating a subtle reflection. As the eye opens, the pupil dilates naturally, showing awareness and life returning. In the glossy surface of the orca's eye, there's a faint reflection of the small brown seal.

Camera transitions to extreme close-up: Focus primarily on the orca's eye opening, with the seal's paw still visible in frame touching the orca's head. This is the emotional climax - the moment of hope. Use very shallow depth of field - the eye in sharp focus, background completely blurred into soft blue-grey and golden tones.

The seal notices the eye opening and continues its gentle touch with even more care. The seal's whiskers quiver slightly, its eyes show hope and relief. The seal maintains contact, comforting the orca.

Final moments (last 5 seconds): Camera slowly pulls back just slightly to show both the seal and the orca's face together - the tiny seal's caring paws on the massive whale's head, the orca's eye now open and aware, creating a moment of profound connection between two unlikely friends.

The orca's breathing becomes slightly more visible - very subtle chest movement. The seal continues its comforting touch. This frozen moment captures hope, compassion, and the unexpected bonds in nature.

Visual details: Maximum detail level - every whisker on the seal should be visible and naturally animated. The orca's eye must be photorealistic with proper corneal reflection, moisture, pupil dilation. Wet textures on both animals with subtle specularity. Golden sand particles on the orca's white belly are clearly visible in close-up. Seal's fur shows depth with subsurface scattering effect in backlight areas.

Background: Completely blurred in extreme close-ups (bokeh effect), showing only soft colors - golden sand, blue-grey sky, hint of turquoise ocean. The emotional focus is entirely on the animals' connection.

Lighting: Soft, diffused natural overcast light. In the extreme close-up of the eye, show subtle catch lights (eye reflections). Gentle rim lighting on the seal's fur creates separation from background. The lighting should feel natural but cinematically beautiful - like high-end wildlife documentary.

Color palette: Rich warm browns of seal fur, deep blacks and cream-whites of orca, with the background desaturated into soft golden and blue-grey tones. Slight color grading to enhance emotional warmth in this hopeful moment.

Camera movement: Slow, deliberate push-in to extreme close-up of eye (first 7 seconds), hold on eye opening moment (3-4 seconds), then slow gentle pull-back to show seal and orca together (final 4-5 seconds). All movements are smooth and gentle, matching the tender emotional tone.

Audio suggestion (if applicable): Soft ambient sounds - distant ocean waves, gentle wind, seal's breathing, orca's deep slow breath. Emotional piano or strings could underscore the moment (if adding music in post).

Emotion: Deep caring transitions to hope and joy as the orca shows life. The final moment is profound connection - transcending species, showing universal compassion. Heartwarming and touching conclusion.

End with a lingering shot of the two animals together, seal comforting orca, both alive and connected. A perfect emotional resolution.
