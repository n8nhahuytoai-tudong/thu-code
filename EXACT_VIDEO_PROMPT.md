3. **Post-production:**
   - Import vào Premiere Pro
   - Color grading (LUT)
   - Transitions smoothing
   - Sound design
   - Final export

## 🎬 KẾT LUẬN

**Đây là prompt được viết dựa trên PHÂN TÍCH CHÍNH XÁC từ video gốc của bạn.**

### Điểm mạnh của video gốc:
✅ Cảm xúc mạnh mẽ, chân thật
✅ Kích thước tương phản ấn tượng
✅ Lighting tự nhiên, không quá dramatic
✅ Chi tiết texture rất đẹp (lông ướt, da orca)
✅ Storytelling rõ ràng không cần lời
✅ Vertical format perfect cho social media

### Để tái tạo thành công:
1. Tập trung vào EMOTIONAL BEATS
2. Chi tiết texture phải realistic
3. Camera movement phải smooth, subtle
4. Color grading quan trọng (desaturated natural look)
5. Thời gian cho close-up scenes (đây là phần quan trọng nhất!)
